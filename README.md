## Architecture Patterns iOS

In this repository there are some iOS projects to represent an example app with different architecture patterns.

Also, there is a Makefile to generate a template using [Sourcery Pod](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery). It is only necessary to run a `make` command in this current directory and type the desired file name.
